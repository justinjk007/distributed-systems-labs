* Task #1: Visualizing Lamport Logical Clocks
# For Task (1), discuss the results of sample run (1) and (2). Did it
# show the expected output? If no then what should be the correct
# output?  Why the visual presentation is important to understand the
# logical clock relationship?What did you learn from Task 1? Did you
# face any difficulty? If so mention that.(10marks)

Task 1 of the lab was done to understand Lamport's way of using logical clocks to synchronize events
in a distributed system. Lamport system provided a simple way of maintaining clocks using simple
counters so events can be executed in the right order to a certain extend. After entering the
correct number of events and event times to the already given the the outputs matched the expected
results. The visual representation makes it easy to understand how many process are involved, how
many tasks each process and what is happening at each stage of the counters, the visual makes it
easy to see where tasks originated from and which process it is going to. No difficulty was faced
during this task, once I understood Lamport Logical clocks are simply based on basic counters and
each event can only happen if its counter is bigger than the host, made the task easy to do.

* Task #2: Logical Timestamps
# What did you learn from Task 2? What challenges did you face and how did you solve that?Now, given
# two events a and b, if event a →b, then Lamport timestamp of a is less than Lamport timestamp of b,
# i.e.  L(a) < L(b).  However, theconverse is not true (if L(a) < L(b) then we cannot infer that
# a→b). Discuss specific examples or events from your sample run for Task (2) to demonstrate both
# cases.

Task 2 was done to learn how Lamport clocks can be used to get the timing of order events that might
take place between multiple processes in a distributed system. With this system if we know when
processes need to communicate to other nodes in a distributed system along with other local
processes in an orderly manner, we know if the order is correct with what we expect to happen. Task
2 simulated the fast and correct order in which these processes might communicate while maintaining
the order of the events.

According to Lamport a→b, then timestamp of a should be less than b, So for
example based on the sample run we used Process 1 sends data to process 2 as part of its lifetime,
at which point the clock counter of process 1 is 2 and the when process 2 receives it its clock
counter is 3, so it is correct to receive that data and process it.

Lamport also says that if the timestamp of *a* is less than *b* we are not totally sure if the event
*a* happened before *b*, this could the case where a happened in a process where many task more that
that of other taken place independently of the process one, making it count more tasks than the
other.
